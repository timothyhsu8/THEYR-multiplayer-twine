November 18th, 1519.  Just off the shore of Cuba. <br>
<br>
You stand on the deck of the ship watching the city of Santiago de Cuba recede towards the horizon.  The wind has caught the sails, and the ship creaks as it begins to heel.  You can barely hear Velázquez yelling into the wind, yelling at Cortés to turn around and come back.<br>
<br>
Velázquez is mad, and he hasn't yet discovered that, under Cortés' orders, you and the other men have raided the city's main storehouse, stealing all the provisions you hoped would last you through the uncertain adventures ahead.<br>
<br>
You watch as Cortés cups his hands to his mouth, shouting back to the governor "Forgive me, Your Worship, for this and similar things have to be done rather than thought about!"<br>
<br>
Cortés turns his back on the governor, looking at you and the rest of your compadres in arms.  <br>

Your spies have witnessed turmoil among the foreigners. Their leader was seen moving their canoes to land and when the other men saw what he had done, they were clearly angry.

Welcome to the Spanish Aztec War! 
<<set $charCreated="true">>
You are part of the <<print $faction>>

Let me tell you a bit about your people: 
<<switch $faction>>
<<case "Aztecs" >>
 You are the mighty Aztec Empire! You are conquerors of central Mexico, who have claimed vast stretches of territory and stricken fear into the hearts of your enemies--the delicious hearts of your enemies! It is now spring of 1519, and you’ve received word that a group of strange men have landed on your shores. Reports indicate that these men do not come from neighboring states that remain to be conquered, but have instead arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. You are curious about these visitors and send a delegation to investigate. What is their purpose here? 
 
<<case "Spaniards">>
You are bold and noble Spaniards! You have set forth into the unknown to claim new lands for the Holy Roman Emperor, Charles V, and new converts to the Catholic faith. It is spring of 1519, and you have made your way up the coast of what appears to be an enormous landmass, into unknown territory. You have unfurled your flag, loudly proclaimed the requerimiento for all to hear, and have succeeded in establishing communication with the natives. And what they have said draws your attention. They tell you of a great city that lies to the west, a city full of gold and countless wonders. You can barely contain your excitement. And yet, there’s one small problem: the King has only granted his permission to explore the coast and not to venture inland. You already left Cuba against the orders of the Governor, Diego Velazquez, who revoked his own permission shortly before you left. Will you risk violating the orders of the crown to pursue what may be little more than a rumor?

<<case "Tlaxcalans">>
 You are indomitable Tlaxcalan warriors! For generations, you have fought back against the Aztecs and maintained your independence. It is now spring of 1519, and you’ve received word that a group of strange men have landed on the shores to the east. Reports indicate that these men arrived from the sea, traveling on small islands made of wood. They bring with them giant deer, like nothing seen before, and a group of Mayan slaves. It is clear that they are no friends of yours, but are they friends of your enemies? When you hear that they plan to advance towards the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán, you prepare yourself for battle, as it seems likely they will cross through your territory--a territory you have defended valiantly until now.

Mexica, over the last 200 years, you have vanquished your enemies one by one to become the most powerful city-state in central Mexico. Your first leader, Acamapichtli, was a son of the Culhua, descended from the Toltecs. This lineage secured his political legitimacy, and with him that of the empire. Religious legitimacy has been harder to come by, however, for it must be granted by the god Quetzalcoatl and the priests who wield his power.<br>
<br>
Many moons ago, during the time of the 4th sun, Quetzalcoatl walked the Earth and ruled over the sacred city of Tollan. Jealous of his power, Quetzalcoatl’s brother, Tezcatlipoca, disguised himself as a sorcerer and tricked Quetzalcoatl into drunkenly cavorting with his sister, the priestess Quetzalpetlatl. The next day, Quetzalcoatl left Tollan in shame, never to return. Quetzalcoatl died in exile, whereupon he was cremated and his remains mixed with the blood of four sacrificed children to symbolize his heart. The heart was then placed in a wooden box and locked in one of the many temples that dot the landscape of central Mexico.

Jealous of his power, Quetzalcoatl’s brother, Tezcatlipoca, disguised himself as a sorcerer and tricked Quetzalcoatl into drunkenly cavorting with his sister, the priestess Quetzalpetlatl. The next day, Quetzalcoatl left Tollan in shame, never to return. Quetzalcoatl died in exile, whereupon he was cremated and his remains mixed with the blood of four sacrificed children to symbolize his heart. The heart was then placed in a wooden box and locked in one of the many temples that dot the landscape of central Mexico. The priests who guard this temple hold great power and only they can grant <<link "the blessing that you seek" "The Tlaxcalan Quest for Legitimacy">><<set $Tlaxcalans_currentMap=2>><</link>>.<br>

You return from your journey to find the village buzzing with news. One of your spies has just returned from the coast, where a band of strangers recently arrived from across the sea. The strangers are pale in skin and covered in hair. They have been giving gifts to people of the coast and winning their affection. These coastal people are allied to the Mexica, but have been brutalized by them. Like so many others in the empire, they harbor deep resentment for their Aztec overlords.<br>
<br>
Rumor has it that the strangers have been warned about the Mexica, but show little fear. They have asked many questions about the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán and how they might reach it.<br>

It is clear to everyone that they cannot risk losing hundreds more men in battle and there is little doubt that, even if the strange men leave, they will return again in the future. Not only would the Chontal people be vulnerable to the strangers, but the devastating losses would also weaken them in the face of their traditional enemies. The chiefs send a messenger to offer peace. <br>

Marina, the last few days have seen a flurry of activity in the village. The Chontal leaders have been gathering food and jewelry to offer the strangers in a show of peace and friendship. Their greatest offering, however, will be a group of twenty women. These will not be the sisters or the daughters of powerful families, offered in marriage to secure alliances; instead they will be slave women, with whom the foreigners might do what they choose. The master of your house has informed you that you will be included in the offering and you are sent to join the others.<br>

When you are brought before the foreigners, one of the men performs a ceremony, speaking strange words that you cannot understand and sprinkling water over your head. He points at you while repeating the word “Marina” over and over. You understand that this is what they will call you.<br>

Marina, you will go down in history for living an extraordinary life, but historian Camilla Townsend has noted that your childhood was, in fact, quite ordinary. Your earliest years were marked by Nahua rituals, lessons, and roles assigned to you at birth. Even your sale into slavery was not uncommon, but is instead reflective of the social and political dynamics that defined your world. <br>
<br>
That story is one you know well, but it will be lost to future generations. Here is your chance to correct the historical record.<br>

A rumor has reached your village that a band of strange men have arrived upon the coast. Is this a chance to change your fortune? What might you tell these men about yourself that will work to your advantage? <br>

Do not hesitate in this journey, for you are not the only ones seeking this treasure. Your sworn enemies, the Tlaxcalans, have fought valiantly against you for many years and have resisted conquest.

:: Act 3, Scene 1: The Great Encounter {"position":"5144,489","size":"100,100"}
Causeway leading into Tenochtitlán, November 8th, 1519

The Spaniards’ journey is finally done and with their Tlaxcalan companions at their side, they descend upon the city of Tenochtitlán. As the city comes into view, Cortes and his men can barely believe their eyes. Situated in the middle of Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlán is a marvel of engineering, connected to the lake’s shores by a series of causeways. As the Spaniards approach, they see an enormous temple rising up from the middle of the city. 
 

An Aztec delegation comes out to meet them. Among them is none other than the Emperor Moctezuma himself. Though he is barefoot, Moctezuma is richly dressed and escorted by his brother, Cuitlahuac, and his Prime Minister, Tlacaelel the Younger. Cortes dismounts his horse and approaches the Emperor to embrace him, sparking horror among the Aztecs, who prevent Cortes from laying hands upon their leader.
 

A ritual then unfolds, with each of the Aztecs bowing to kiss the ground. Each then greets Cortes in turn. When he reaches Moctezuma, Cortes presents the Emperor with a necklace of pearls and glass beads. Moctezuma, in turn, places two necklaces adorned with golden shrimp around the neck of Cortes. 
 

All three factions mingle on the causeway, getting to know each other and formulating their next move. Use this opportunity to get a sense of the opposing side. What do you think they are planning? Who do you trust?

Spaniards, you have been at sea for many weeks when you land on the shores of Cozumel.<br>
<br>

<<if $Span_Leader is $users[$userId]['role']>>
To your surprise, the residents of the island see you and begin shouting words that sound distinctly like “Castilan, Castilan!” You question the local people, who tell that they’ve heard rumors of Spaniards living as slaves two days journey inland. Excited at the news, you write a letter:<br>
<br>
“Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living. The ship will wait eight days for you. Come in all haste, and you will be welcomed and protected. I am here at this Island with five hundred soldiers and eleven ships, in which I go on, please God, to a town called Tabasco or Potonchan.”<br>
<br>
You find a pair of local messengers and instruct them to find these mysterious Spanish slaves. You tell them to deliver your letter, along with a ransom of beads that they may use to pay the men’s owners. <br>

:: Aguilar Receives a Letter [Done Breaks] {"position":"490,766","size":"100,100"}
Since hearing the rumor of the strangers on the coast, you have been quietly plotting your escape. Unfortunately, the opportunity to flee has not yet presented itself. <br>
<br>
<<if ndef $Letter or $Letter eq "">>

You continue to bide your time and wait for your opening.<br>
<br>
<img src="images/Stop_1.png" style="width:60%; margin:auto; display:block;">

<<elseif $Letter is "sent">>

A day after you first hear the rumor, you are approached by the Mayan lord who has been your master these long years. He tells you that a pair of messengers have arrived from the coast, bearing beautiful gifts. A group of strangers have come who desire your release and they have paid him handsomely. Your master informs you that you are free and hands you a letter. It reads: <br>
<br>
“Gentlemen and brothers, here in Cozumel I have learnt that you are captives in the hands of a Cacique, and I pray you that you come here to Cozumel at once, and for this purpose I have sent a ship with soldiers, in case you have need of them, and a ransom to be paid to those Indians with whom you are living. The ship will wait eight days for you. Come in all haste, and you will be welcomed and protected. I am here at this Island with five hundred soldiers and eleven ships, in which I go on, please God, to a town called Tabasco or Potonchan.”<br>
<br>
You are elated at the message and set out in search of your former companion, Gonzalo Guerrero. Together, you were the sole survivors of the wreck that left you here among the Maya, but unlike you, Guerrero has adopted this new land and forsaken his one true God. Unlike you, Guerrero has not lived out these long years as a slave.<br>
<br>
When you find him, you share the letter. Guerrero reads it and, much to your dismay, he refuses to leave. “Brother Aguilar,” he says to you, “I am married and have three children and the Indians look on me as a Cacique and captain in wartime,--You go and God be with you, but I have my face tattooed and my ears pierced, what would the Spaniards say should they see me in this guise?”<br>
<br>
You inform Guerrero that God will never forgive him and warn him that he will be punished for his sins. And then you <<link "head for the coast" "Spaniards arrive at Yucatan">><<set $L_Received="Yes">><</link>>.<br>

Upon hearing the news, you reflect upon a series of omens that have occurred in recent years. <br>
<br>
First, a fiery comet appeared in the sky and showed itself for a full year.<br>
<br>
Second, a fire consumed the Temple of Huitzilopochtli that could not be put out. When the residents of Tenochtitlán threw water upon the fire, it only grew stronger.<br>
<br>
Third, lightning struck the Temple of Xiuhteuctli, despite the fact that it was barely raining.<br>
<br>
Fourth, a comet fell from the sky in the middle of the day. The comet had three tails and where they were seen, they made a great noise, like the sound of rattles.<br>
<br>
Fifth, the waters of Lake Texcoco set fire, boiling and bubbling, destroying houses along the shore.<br>
<br>
Sixth, at night, a woman could  be heard crying out, “O my children, we are about to go forever.” “O my children, where am I to take you?”<br>
<br>
Seventh, the residents of Lake Texcoco caught a strange bird, like a crane. Its skull was deformed and reflected the stars, like a mirror. When Moctezuma peered into the mirror, he saw a group of men marching, outfitted for war and carried on the backs of deer.<br>
<br>
Eighth, strange creatures appeared in the city, creatures with two heads but only one body. When they were taken to Moctezuma, he looked upon them and they disappeared.<br>

They tell you that they come in the name of the great Emperor, Moctezuma, and each man bows to kiss the earth.

Countless trinkets of gold glisten before you in the sunlight.<br>

After presenting their gifts, the men deliver a message on behalf of their prince, Moctezuma. Their leader, they claim, “was pleased that such valiant men, as he had heard they were, should come to his country,” for Moctezuma had heard reports of your battle in Tabasco. However, the men assure you that there is no need for a meeting between your two sides. In fact, they tell you the journey to Mexico is treacherous and you would best head back the way you came.<br>

At sea behind them is the biggest canoe you have ever seen. They speak to each other in a strange language, but their message is given to you by a woman who speaks your own tongue. They ask who you are and from whence you came. You tell the strangers that you come from Mexico and you have been sent by the great Moctezuma. You come bearing gifts. <br>
<br>
The strangers watch in fascination as you lay the gifts at their feet: bolts of cloth, a head fan made of the finest quetzal feathers, and countless trinkets of yellow metal. It is these last items that seem to draw the strangers’ attention. You then deliver Moctezuma’s message, advising the strangers not to make the journey inland. It is known that they want to meet your leader in person, but such a meeting is not necessary, you tell them. The road is long and dangerous.

<<print $Span_Leader>>, you have heard rumors and rumblings amongst your faction that they are planning a mutiny. You don’t know whether or not this is true, but you are fearful for your life and must not let them rob you of the glory that lies ahead. As you move to the group discussion board on the next screen, you must ensure that the entire faction is ready to follow you inland in pursuit of your dreams.<br>
<br>
You weigh your options and decide that the best course of action is the boldest: retreat cannot be an option! You will beach the ships so that your crew has no choice but to forge onward. Though not destroyed, fixing the ships would require many weeks of repair, assuming they could even find the necessary materials. <br>

You continue along the coast, stopping next at a place called Tabasco. <br>
<br>
As you make your way inland, curious what lies ahead, you hear the sound of drums. You barely have time to process the sound before you realize that you’ve been surrounded by an entire army of native warriors, their faces painted in black and white, armed bows and arrows, lances, slings, and stones.<br>
<br>
Recalling this event years later, Bernal Diaz wrote: 
“they rushed upon us like mad dogs completely surrounding us, and they let fly such a cloud of arrows, javelins and stones that on the first assault they wounded over seventy of us...I remember that when we fired shots the Indians gave great shouts and whistles and threw dust and rubbish into the air so that we should not see the damage done to them, and they sounded their trumpets and drums and shouted and whistled and cried ‘Alala! Alala!’”<br>
<br>
Your battle with the Tabascans was fierce, but in the end it was the cavalry that secured your victory. Your horsemen arrived late to the battle and overwhelmed the native force. You manage to take five captives and send two of them back to their leader, laden with beads and gifts. Speaking in the strange native tongue, Aguilar instructs them to deliver a message: The native peoples of this land have nothing to fear, for you come in peace. <br>

For weeks now, the Chontal leaders have been hearing rumors that a group of foreigners has been traveling along the coast, making their way towards your village. When word arrived that they had landed upon your shores, the local chiefs sent an army to head them off. Much to everyone’s surprise, many of the men came back wounded, telling stories of their defeat. <br>
<br>
They recount the harrowing tale to their leaders, telling of dirty men with pale skin and unkempt hair. The warriors surrounded the strangers and quickly overwhelmed them, firing their arrows and piercing them with spears. They were sure they had killed at least two strangers. They were sure they had secured a victory, only to be shocked by the most terrifying sights. First, there was the loudest noise they had ever heard, so loud it left the men deaf and disoriented. The noise was immediately followed by a giant stone that flew through the air, raining fire down upon them. Second, a team of men descended on them, riding upon the backs of the biggest deer they had ever seen! Wounded and terrified, the warriors fled, but not everyone made it out. Over two hundred men fell dead in the battle.<br>
<br>
Never before have you felt such fear among the Chontal people. As they consider their next move, [[you wonder what these events might mean for you|Marina Tells Her Story]].<br>

Your spies have been busy keeping watch over events along the coast and they have many stories to tell. It seems a delegation of Mexica went in search of the strangers who arrived by sea and warned them not to make the journey to Tennochtitlán. The foreigners paid little heed to the Mexica’s warnings and have requested a meeting with the Emperor Moctezuma. The local people have informed your spies that the leader of the foreigners seems determined to make the journey inland.<br>

:: The Library [Done] {"position":"521,25","size":"100,100"}
It’s six weeks into the semester and you’re already drowning in work. You have your first exams this week, you need to get started on some research, and now your history professor has sprung a surprise assignment on you at the last minute--and it’s due tomorrow! The only way you’re going to get everything done is to pull an all-nighter. There’s no way you’ll be able to stay awake at home; your bed is there and it’s just too tempting. So you head to the library. <br>
<br>
It’s 7 pm and the library is more crowded than usual. It looks like you’re not the only one with a mountain of work to do this week! There’s no way you’ll be able to focus in the midst of so many people. Maybe the top floor is quieter. You head upstairs towards the study carrels, but they’re all taken. It’s dead quiet up here, but there’s nowhere to work. You begin wandering down unfamiliar hallways, poking your head into all the different rooms, but none of them work. You’re beginning to get frustrated when you notice a door you’ve never seen before. It’s tucked into an alcove in the very back corner of the building. You decide to check this one last spot before you give up and join the masses downstairs. <br>
<br>
The door sticks as you try to open it, but you can tell it’s not locked. You give it a pull and it creaks open, revealing a tiny room piled high with books and a single, overstuffed chair. There’s not a soul to be found. When you close the door behind you, you can’t even hear the sound of the H-VAC that hums through the rest of the building. This is perfect. You can’t believe your luck! <br>
<br>
You unload your books and make yourself comfortable--maybe a little too comfortable. You get to work on your assignment, but within a matter of minutes your eyes get heavy. You struggle to stay awake but it’s impossible to focus. Maybe a ten-minute nap will help. You tell yourself that if you just get it out of your system, you’ll be good to go for the rest of the night. You close your eyes and quickly slip into a deep sleep. <br>
<br>
Suddenly, <<link "you’re startled by a loud noise" "Character Identification">><<set $Spaniards_currentMap=1>><<set $Spaniards_strength = 7>><<set $Tlaxcalans_currentMap=1>><<set $Tlaxcalans_strength = 7>><<set $Aztecs_currentMap=1>><<set $Aztecs_strength = 7>><</link>>!<br>

:: Waking up in the library [Done Breaks] {"position":"1192,2282","size":"100,100"}
You slowly pull yourself awake.  It takes real effort, you were sleeping so deeply.  You’re confused, there is nothing worse than waking up mid-dream. <br>
<br>
What is that noise? Nothing makes sense...<br>
<br>
You shake your head and catch sight of something glowing on the table next to you. <br>
<br>
Your phone. It is full of texts from your friends. Where have you been? Is your history assignment done?<br>
<br>
Your heart starts to race. You look around the room.  The library! Your assignment!  You grab your phone from the table next to you, class starts in just an hour! What are you going to do? <br>
<br>
It all comes flooding back.  That dream was weird, so realistic, but you came here to get your history paper done. And now you’ve lost the whole night!<br>
<br>
You start to gather up your things frantically, praying that somehow you’ll find the time to complete the assignment. You knock the pile of books off the little side table next to you, and a neatly stapled stack of paper floats gently to the floor.  <br>
<br>
You grab it, you look, you start reading.  Your history assignment, it is done!  Did you complete it before you fell asleep? You read more. This is good, like really good! You wrote this? You are pretty sure you are getting an A!<br>
<br>
You take a deep breath, you gather your things up calmly. You can’t believe it. You don’t remember writing this brilliant paper, but here it is, done. And you feel rested, if a bit disoriented.  Everything is going to be alright after all! You text your friends.  You'll meet them in class.<br>
<br>
As you close the door of the weird little room behind you, you know <<link "you'll be back" "return to the library_no door">><<set $Tlaxcalans_currentMap=1000>><<set $Aztecs_currentMap=1000>><<set $Spaniards_currentMap=1000>><</link>>.

<br>
For three nights straight, you haven’t slept a wink. You’ve lain awake worrying and trying to mentally prepare for what might lie ahead. After so many sleepless days, you’re exhausted and you lie down upon your reed mat for the night. As soon as you close your eyes, you slip into a deep sleep. <br>

You made it through a full day of classes, but it was torture. You couldn’t concentrate on anything because all you could think about was that mysterious room and the history assignment you don’t remember writing. I mean, you must have written it, right? You feel a little guilty about handing it in, but you decide not to think too hard about that.<br>
<br>
It’s now late afternoon and you’re finally free for the day. You hurry back to the library, excited to revisit the mystery room and its big comfy chair. You hope that if you look closely, you’ll find some clue to what happened...some indication that you really did write that killer paper.<br>
<br>
You arrive on the top floor and round the corner but you can’t find the door! You swear this is exactly where you found it before, but it’s not here. Confused, you scour every corner of the library to no avail. The door is nowhere to be found. You head home feeling deeply unsettled.<br>
<br>

<<audio "Library" play>>

A week has passed and every day you’ve gone back to the library after class, looking for the mysterious room. You’ve explored every inch of the building, growing increasingly desperate with every day that goes by. Every night you’ve lain awake for hours, trying to figure out what happened and whether you just imagined the whole thing. You wonder if you’re losing your mind, because it sure feels like it.<br>
<br>
Your history teacher didn’t help the situation when she handed back your assignment today. It turns out you really did write it. And you got an A. You now have another assignment due next week and you’re extra stressed because now the bar is way too high! Your teacher is going to expect A-level work from you every time and you’re just not sure it’s in you.<br>
<br>
It’s the end of the day and you know you should go home and get to work on this new assignment, but you just can’t stop yourself from going back to the library. It’s become an obsession. Just like every other day for the last week, you start on the top floor in the back corner. You brace yourself for the worst, knowing that you won’t find what you were looking for, but there it is! You can barely believe your eyes. <br>
<br>
You carefully reach for the door knob, afraid that it will disappear before you can grasp it. But it doesn’t! You turn the handle, give the door a good pull, and it opens to reveal the room exactly as you remember it: books piled high, overstuffed chair, one small table. How is this even happening? This can’t be real...can it?<br>

Though their affections are worrisome, and even outright frightening, you wonder if this might work to your advantage. Would it be to your benefit to form a relationship with one of these men?

After a long stay in Tlaxcala, where you recovered from battle and enjoyed the hospitality of your new allies, you set out for the Mexica capital of Tenochtitlán. Your forces took a hit in the long and hard-fought battle with Tlaxcala, and you now number only 250--only half the number who set sail from Cuba! However, you have succeeded in building a massive army of indigenous allies. You march onward with a force of 10,000 men. <br>
<br>
Before you enter the capital, you have one important stop to make: the city of Cholula, where you will stock up on some much-needed supplies. You have been assured that this stop is necessary, but it might not be easy. Until recently, the people of Cholula were allies of your Tlaxcalan friends, but now the city’s leadership is loyal to the Mexica. There is clearly bad blood between the two peoples and you stay on guard as you approach the city.<br>

You leave Tlaxcala headed for the city of Tenochtitlán.<br>
<br>
You must make one stop along the way, however: the city of Cholula. The people of Cholula were your loyal allies for many years, until they betrayed you to become loyal vassals of the Mexica. There is bad blood between you and you long to make the cowardly Cholulans pay for their betrayal.<br>
<br>
As you approach the city, your blood boils, but you remain calm and alert. It’s getting dark and your Spanish allies decide to stop for the night, so you set up camp and lie down upon your reed mat to get some rest.<br>

<i>“The next morning we reached the broad high road of Iztapalapan, whence we for the first time beheld the numbers of towns and villages built in the lake, and the still greater number of large townships on the mainland, with the level causeway which ran in a straight line into Mexico. Our astonishment was indeed raised to the highest pitch, and we could not help remarking to each other, that all these buildings resembled the fairy castles we read of in Amadis de Gaul; so high, majestic, and splendid did the temples, towers, and houses of the town, all built of massive stone and lime, rise up out of the midst of the lake. Indeed, many of our men believed what they saw was a mere dream. And the reader must not feel surprised at the manner in which I have expressed myself, for it is impossible to speak coolly of things which we had never seen nor heard of, nor even could have dreamt of, beforehand.” (Lockhart, 219)</i><br>

You wake to find yourself exactly where you hoped: back at camp, on the road to Tenochtitlán! You lead an army of over 10,000 men, with your Spanish allies at your side.<br>
<br>

You pack up camp and set out for your destination, assuring your Spanish friends that it’s just around the corner. You crest a hill and the city appears before you. Your friends can hardly believe their eyes. One of them would later describe it as such:<br>
<br>

<i>“The next morning we reached the broad high road of Iztapalapan, whence we for the first time beheld the numbers of towns and villages built in the lake, and the still greater number of large townships on the mainland, with the level causeway which ran in a straight line into Mexico. Our astonishment was indeed raised to the highest pitch, and we could not help remarking to each other, that all these buildings resembled the fairy castles we read of in Amadis de Gaul; so high, majestic, and splendid did the temples, towers, and houses of the town, all built of massive stone and lime, rise up out of the midst of the lake. Indeed, many of our men believed what they saw was a mere dream. And the reader must not feel surprised at the manner in which I have expressed myself, for it is impossible to speak coolly of things which we had never seen nor heard of, nor even could have dreamt of, beforehand.” (Lockhart, 219)</i><br>

:: Tlaxcalans consider their options {"position":"3850,364","size":"100,100"}
The Aztec capital may be impressive, rising up from the lake, but it’s teeming with your enemies. You have battled the Aztecs many times before. Is this time any different? You lead an army of 10,000 allies who share your hatred of the Aztecs. The Spanish force is small, but they carry powerful weapons and they ride their giant deer.<br>
<br>
This is your final opportunity to weigh your options before you reach the point of no return. Go to the <a href="https://discord.gg/md2BRJWcW3" target="_blank"> Tlaxcalan discussion board </a> and decide on your best course of action. <br>
<br>
Option 1: This is your best chance to defeat the Aztecs. You’ve waited years for this opportunity and you’re not about to let it slip away from you now! You will carry on to the city.<br>
<br>
Option 2: You have serious doubts about the Spaniards in your camp. Recent events have led you to wonder if they might be a more immediate threat than your Aztec enemies. You send a messenger to Tenochtitlán to negotiate an alliance.<br>
<br>
Option 3: You have serious doubts about the Spaniards in your camp. You wonder if they’re leading you into a losing battle with the hated Aztecs. You decide to cut your losses. You leave the Spaniards to their fate and head for home.<br>
<br>
Option 4: You have long doubted the Spaniards in your camp and already made a secret alliance with the Aztecs. After recent events, you are more convinced than ever that this was the right decision. You will honor your alliance with the Aztecs and enter the city as friends.<br>

Your journey is long and arduous, but at least it is familiar this time. Along the way, you prepare your allies for what you might encounter. Your Tlaxcalan friends listen closely and you can’t help but wonder at their allegiance. As you prepare to face Velazquez’ forces, you are completely at the mercy of your native allies.

You travel for many days and many nights. Cortes warns you of the force that you will likely encounter. They will be men like his own, but they will carry even more weapons. He reminds you of the battle you once fought against each other and the giant pipes that made smoke and noise. He calls them cannons and prepares you to face them once again.<br>
<br>
As you make your way to the coast, you and your compatriots discuss your options. Will you fight for Cortes, as he has asked? Is it worth it? What might you gain if you do?<br>

You confer with your Tlaxcalan allies, who assure you they will fight by your side. You decide that the best course of action is not to confront the enemy head on, but to take them by surprise in a sneak attack.<br>
<br>
You wait until midnight to launch your attack, hoping to catch the enemy forces asleep. After a quick and bloody battle, you succeed in capturing their leader, Pánfilo Narváez, who miraculously survives being stuck in the eye with a pike. You put Narváez in chains, disarm the remainder of his men, and give them a choice: return to Cuba or join you in Tenochtitlán. <br>
<br>
Fortunately for you, these men are no fools. They have heard tales of the great Mexica city and the riches found there. Hundreds of them choose to join you. You have just quadrupled your forces. This could not have gone better.<br>

You wait until midnight to launch your attack, hoping to catch the enemy forces asleep. After a quick and bloody battle, you succeed in capturing the leader and disarming his men. When Cortes gives them the choice of going back where they came from or joining you on the return journey, very few choose to turn back. Your force has just grown considerably. You make your way back to Tenochtitlán.<br>
<br>
As you depart the scene of the battle, Cortes instructs you to take the large and terrifying weapons that these new Spaniards brought with them. He tells you they are called cannons and asks you to take them to Tlaxcala for safekeeping. [[You prepare to finally return home|Tlaxcalans take cannons to Tlaxcala]].<br>

Much to your dismay, your fears turn out to be valid. As you near Tlaxcala,  <<print $Tlax_Leader>> informs you that he and his men will not be carrying on the rest of the way. They will remain in Tlaxcala, leaving you to face the enemy with a greatly-diminished force.<br>
<br>
This news comes as a terrible blow. The odds are no longer in your favor.<br>
<br> 
You spend the night in Tlaxcala and lie awake all night weighing your next move. Will you try to catch Velazquez’ men off guard in a sneak attack or is it safer to negotiate an agreement?<br>

<br>
Cortes takes the news with a steely glare and it is clear that he is not happy with the news. With the loss of your men, his forces are greatly diminished. But this is not your battle to fight.<br>

You make your way towards your private quarters, formulating a plan of escape. You hope they will be occupied fighting off the mob outside, but much to your dismay, they have sent men to track you down and put you in shackles. You find yourself a prisoner to the Spaniards, who inform you that you must now do their bidding if you want to live. What have you done to so displease the Gods? You are the mighty Aztec Emperor! This indignity shall never be forgiven. <br>

The assault on the palace lasts for days, but the Spaniards are well-armed and defend their position. When it finally stops, the city becomes eerily quiet. Food stops flowing into the palace and it’s clear your people are trying to starve out the enemy, and you with them.<br>

The assault on the palace proves futile and the city’s nobles convince the people to lay down their arms, for now. You must save your energy for the battle that is soon to come. You begin to prepare the city for battle, building new walls, blocking access to canals, and laying traps. You cut off supplies to the palace, hoping to starve out the enemy and punish this king who has failed you so.<br>

The people have lost faith in <<print $Aztec_Leader>>. It is clear that he is no longer capable of leading your people. You gather the council [[for a meeting|Aztec Leader Lives and Aztecs Choose a Leader Riot]].<br>

You have decided that the risk of keeping <<print $Aztec_Leader>> alive outweighs the benefit. This injury at the hands of his people has provided you with an excellent opportunity: you can put an end to him and they will never know. You decide to finish him off and send him to meet his Gods. <br>
<br>
You send a messenger to the roof of the palace to inform the residents of Tenochtitlán that their leader is dead, brought down by the hands of his own people! Though you fear another riot, the city remains strangely calm.

<<if $users[$userId]['role'] is $Aztec_Leader>>
Someone is carrying you back into the palace. Even in your confusion, you can feel the tension in the air. Your captors seem nervous and have been whispering excitedly amongst themselves. <br>
<br>
As you feel the knife in your back, you cry out to your attacker. Do you not deserve a more dignified death than this?! As you slip into darkness, you wonder one last time how your gods could have forsaken you so.<br>
<br>
<<else>>
It is not long before you learn of <<print $Aztec_Leader>>’s fate. After the chaos died down and people retreated back to their homes, a messenger returned to the roof of the palace bearing the worst possible news: <<print $Aztec_Leader>> is dead, toppled by the hand of his own people! <br>
<br>
You yourself watched him fall on the rooftop, but could this really have been his fate? <br>

The council gathers in haste. [[Decisions must be made|Aztec Leader Dies and Aztecs Choose a Leader Riot]]!<br>

You know that only one causeway to the mainland remains and that parts have been destroyed, leaving it impassible. When you learned this, your men gathered wood and built a portable bridge, which you now take with you. <br>
<br>
As quietly as any army that has gone before, you make your way out of the palace through the eerie darkness towards the last remaining causeway. It is all for naught, however! You have been spotted and you watch the lake that surrounds you fill with canoes. Mexica warriors descend upon you from all sides! As you approach the first break in the causeway, your men put down the portable bridge and you are able to cross, but others are not so lucky. The bridge collapses under the weight of so many men and you carry bits of wood in a feeble attempt to cross the next break in the causeway. Chaos surrounds you as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco.<br>
<br>
Somehow, you make it out alive, but not all are so lucky. You scramble your way to shore and run for your life, desperate to [[escape the carnage that lays behind you|Spaniards Decide Whether to Retreat to Tlaxcala]].<br>

The whole city flies into action and you watch the chaos that unfolds before you. It seems there have been spies in your midst, for the strangers carry with them a makeshift bridge. Many moons ago, the residents of the city cut off all but one causeway that connects your island city to the shore. This last remaining causeway was itself made unpassable by long broken stretches, but the Spaniards are prepared. You see them lay down their sad little bridge at the first break in the causeway, only to be shot down by the warriors that have flooded into the lake in their canoes.<br>
<br>
As you run into the fray, cutting down your enemies, you watch as men and horses plummet into the depths of Lake Texcoco. Blinded by the chaos of war, you are vaguely aware that some of the Spaniards have made it down the causeway. Out of the corner of your eye, you watch them scramble to shore, but you must fight where you are and cannot give chase.<br>
